## Features

- 3 distinctive banners: 2 special character banners and 1 normal banner. (All contain different rates).
- Auto-updated Inventory: Any time you pull a cat, the inventory will update, and stay there after you re-login the website.
- Beutiful gacha cutscene.

## Project Status
- Our project will update Login function in the future. Apparently user can select banner, pull gacha and see inventory.

### Challenging
- We see the challenge in making a web application as the backend requires various and deep knowlegde to master, we have to research more on Node Express, MongoDB, as it is popular in industry nowaday. Overall, we manage to overcome it and improve our skill for future work.
